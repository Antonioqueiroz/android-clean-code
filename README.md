# Test Driven Android Development
#### Inspired from [Clean Architecture][1] from Uncle Bob, [Google Android samples] [3]  and [Clean Swift] [2]
##### There could be many awesome design architectures available - this design is choosen with a singular focus - testablity.

## Quick Start
1. Clone and import it to Android Studio
2. It should work with out any issues

Note: OS X Users
1. If Android Studio refuse to work with out .m2 folder at root level, create such folder and execute 'sudo chmod -R 766 .m2'

2. Start the Android Studio as sudo user ( Go to Application folder and run 'sudo open Android\ Studio.app/' )

## Whats Next ?
Want to use it your projects - bothered about the too much boilerplate code ? You can generate them with in few seconds - check [here] [5]

### Contribute
Welcome to contribute, feel free to change and open a PR.

#### TODO
1. Create example test cases for Router
2. Create code & test examples for the detail page.
2. Create templating auto code generation similar to clean-swift - Done check [here] [5]. Inspired from [this link] [4]
