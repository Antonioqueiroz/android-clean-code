# Test Driven Android Development - Clean Code Android
#### Inspired from [Clean Architecture][1] from Uncle Bob, [Google Android samples][3]  and [Clean Swift][2]
##### This design is chosen with a singular focus - testablity.
##### Want to learn about Android Clean Code ? follow [here][7]


## Quick Start
1. Clone and import it to Android Studio
2. It should work with out any issues

Note: Mac Users
1. If Android Studio refuse to work with out .m2 folder at root level, create such folder and execute `sudo chmod -R 766 .m2`
2. Start the Android Studio as sudo user ( Go to Application folder and run `sudo open Android\ Studio.app/` )

## Whats Next ?
Want to use it your projects - bothered about the too much boilerplate code ? You can generate them with in few seconds - check [here][5]
